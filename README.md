# tidyAPM

This repo is a tidymodels companion for the 2013 book "Applied Predictive Modeling". 

The goal of these files is to approximate the analyses in the book with the more modern codebase. 

Some caveats:

 * **This** is a rough draft. It relies on a few devel versions and one experimental package that has not been made public yet (it is named `workflowsets`). 

 * R uses a different random number generator than it did <= 2013, so results won't be exactly the same. 

 * The packages used are much older than they were when _APM_ was written. For example, there have been over 30 releases of `caret` since the book was compiled. There will be differences in results for this reason. 

 * Some analyses in _APM_ haven't been written in tidymodels (yet) so the code here will be incomplete. In other cases, we may have slightly changed our recommendations for how to conduct some of the analyses. If this is the case, an annotation will be used to point this out.
